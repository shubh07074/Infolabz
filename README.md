# TASKS

TASK 1 Fetch Data from API

The first notebook, TASK[1-3].ipynb, appears to start with importing libraries (requests, numpy, and pandas) and loading a COVID-19 data JSON file from an online source. To get a more comprehensive understanding, I'll extract more cells to see if there are descriptions or comments that provide additional context about the tasks.

The second notebook, TASK[4-6].ipynb, also starts with importing libraries (requests, numpy, and pandas) and loading data from an API, this time related to mutual funds. This suggests a project that involves fetching and analyzing financial data.

The third notebook, TASK[7-8].ipynb, starts with importing the requests library and loading data from an API related to ISRO spacecrafts. This indicates a focus on fetching and analyzing space-related data.

The fourth notebook,TASK[7-8]Different_method.ipynb ,starts with importing the requests library and loading data from an API related to ISRO spacecrafts. This indicates a focus on fetching and analyzing space-related data, but using different method.

TASK 2 Student Performance Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs analysis on student performance data. The notebook merges multiple datasets, calculates performance metrics, and generates a consolidated report.

Features
Data Merging: Combines data from different sources into a single DataFrame.
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and ensures data consistency.
Performance Metrics Calculation: Computes total scores and percentages for each student.
Sorting and Filtering: Sorts student data based on total scores from high to low.
Data Export: Exports the final cleaned and processed dataset to a CSV file.

Notebook Details
Data Merging: The notebook merges datasets based on common keys to create a comprehensive student performance dataset.
Sorting: It sorts the students' data by their total scores in descending order, providing a clear ranking of students based on their performance.
Percentage Calculation: Calculates the percentage for each student and identifies pass/fail status.
Export: The final result is exported as finalresult.csv for further use.
